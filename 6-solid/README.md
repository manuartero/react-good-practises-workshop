### SOLID PRINCIPLES

1. Every function/class/component/object should do exactly one thing.
  ```
  ```

2. You should be able to add functionality to some module, without modifying its existing source code (prefer composition to inheritance).
  ```
  ```

3. If B _extends_ A, anywhere you use A you should be able to use B.
  ```
  ```

4. Don't make a component rely on props it doesn't care about.
  ```
  a
  ```

5. High-level code shouldn't depend on implementation details - always use an abstraction.
  ```
  a
  ```
